As a short story, I always had a fond for computers and technology from my childhood. I got that craze from gaming, few articles and science blogs which inspired me to the edge. 

And getting to my first degree, I didn't get the degree I wanted, but tried to do best in that, and at some point I had to rethink and interrogate myself "Am I on the right path?", and deep inside something told me that I'm not. And that's where I realized I have to follow my passion.

Which comes to my second degree B.Sc Computer Science. The field I always wanted to get in, I was so excited and thrilled to have a fresh start. Apart from academics, I learned python from Pierian Academy, Machine Learning from the CEO of Landing AI Mr. Andrew NG on coursera and did some specialization and professional courses where it made my skill-set grow day by day. I scheduled myself to do these things on timely basis. 

I have done some projects as a practice from what I learned. I was amazed to see myself as a dedicated person, which made me to realize, when you're chasing your passion, dedication will run along with you. 

To do all this, I had to analyze myself first, so I started to write a diary about my daily activities and after every month I just go through it and check my qualities and lacking features, so I work on that mentally to improve myself.
